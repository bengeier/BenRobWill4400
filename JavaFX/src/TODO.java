// HIGH PRIORITY

	//TODO adding a new attraction should be sent to manager for approval

	//TODO users that have already reviewed a city should get an "Edit my Review" button (we need to write mySQL UPDATE)
		//related: if user is updating review, there should be a "delete" button option

	//TODO managers should be able to delete a city
	//TODO managers should be able to delete an attraction
	//TODO managers should be able to delete any review they want from a city 
		//(mySQL DELETE and delete button to appear if isManager)
	//TODO managers should be able to delete any review they want from an attraction

	//TODO suspended users should not be able to review attractions from a attractions "all reviews" page 
		//same goes for not reviewing cities from "all reviews" page
	//QUESTION: do we want user to be taken to a city/attraction screen after adding that city/attraction, even if it is still pending?

// LOW PRIORITY

    // TODO Make some tables bigger (especially pending attractions)
    // TODO searched attractions do not always display all categories
    // i.e. if I search for Outdoors attractions in Atlanta, Georgia Tech is displayed, but its categories only show
    // "Outdoors" instead of "Outdoors, Good View"
    // TODO change background color / image
    // TODO Make table columns non editable
    // TODO Make info / link columns non-sortable
